# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

This project uses **Machine Learning** techniques to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines**. It's a classic binary classification task based on real-world data, with applications in undersea object detection.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

The objective is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately identify whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. This type of predictive modeling can be useful in defense, navigation, and exploration technologies.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))
- **Samples**: 208
- **Features**: 60 numerical values per sample representing energy measurements across frequency bands.
- **Labels**: 
  - `R` → Rock  
  - `M` → Mine

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)

## 📈 Model & Approach

We used a **Logistic Regression** model due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification problems.

### Key Steps:
1. Data loading & inspection
2. Data preprocessing & label encoding
3. Model training & validation
4. Performance evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ✅ Results

The model achieved the following performance on the test set:

- **Accuracy**: ~86%
- **Precision (Mine)**: 0.88
- **Recall (Mine)**: 0.85
- **F1-score (Mine)**: 0.86

> Note: Results may vary slightly depending on random state and dataset splitting.
