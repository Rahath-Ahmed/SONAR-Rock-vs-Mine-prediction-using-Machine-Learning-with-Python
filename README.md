# 🔍 SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project applies machine learning to classify objects as either **rock** or **mine** based on SONAR signal data. It uses logistic regression to build a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between the two classes based on 60 numeric frequency-based features.

## 💡 Techniques Used
- **Dataset**: SONAR Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Model**: Logistic Regression  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Train-Test Split

---

## 📊 Dataset
- 208 samples, each with 60 features representing SONAR signal strengths
- Binary labels:  
  - **"R"** for Rock  
  - **"M"** for Mine  
- Source: [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
  ````bash
2. Run each cell in order to:
  - Load and explore the data
  - Train a logistic regression model
  - Evaluate accuracy and make predictions

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting whether a sonar signal represents a mine or a rock.
- Model generalizes well on unseen test data using train-test split validation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to preprocess and explore high-dimensional datasets.
- How to apply logistic regression to binary classification problems.
- How to evaluate classification model performance using scikit-learn.
