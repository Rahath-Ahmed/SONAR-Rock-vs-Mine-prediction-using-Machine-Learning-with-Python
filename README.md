# 🔍 SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project applies machine learning to classify objects as either **rock** or **mine** based on SONAR signal data. It uses logistic regression to build a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between the two classes based on 60 numeric frequency-based features.

## 💡 Techniques Used
- **Dataset**: SONAR Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Model**: Logistic Regression  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Train-Test Split

## 📊 Dataset
- 208 samples, each with 60 features representing SONAR signal strengths
- Binary labels:  
  - **"R"** for Rock  
  - **"M"** for Mine
